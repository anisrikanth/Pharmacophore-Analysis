# Pharmacophore-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to show how one can used RDkit and OpenCADD in order to identifiy pharmacophores in several viral protease inhibitors. In particular, this project takes a look at PF-07321332, a protease inhibitor which has been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19, as well as some earlier analogs which were made in an effort to treat SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold. From the analysis, one can identify the pharmacophores which are important for binding to 3CL proteases, as well as what pharmacophores are shared between these different protease inhibitors.
